# Filter Engine Project

## Overview

The Filter Engine is a robust system designed to handle product and data filtering in a highly efficient and scalable way. It supports a variety of filtering methods, including manual GET parameters, Django Filter integration, and faceted search with multi-select capabilities. The project is optimized for performance, responsive UX, and maintainable code.

This document serves as a detailed guide for understanding the architecture, development steps, and optimization practices used throughout the project.

## Filter Engine Documentation

The home page of this project serves as the **official documentation** for the Filter Engine. It provides a clear, step-by-step guide for developers and stakeholders to understand the architecture, design, and workflow of the system. Each section explains goals, best practices, and UX considerations—from initial project setup and sample data generation to advanced filtering, multi-select faceted search, and performance optimization.

### DOCS Page
### ![](/static/images/docs_page.png)

This documentation emphasizes **intuitive UX, efficient backend design, and maintainable code.** Readers can learn how filters, active tags, pagination, caching, and query optimizations work together to create a fast, scalable, and user-friendly filtering system.

## Step 0: Project Scaffold and Sample Data

**Goal:** Establish a solid foundation for the project and generate realistic test data.

**Project Structure:**

- Create a clear project structure with dedicated apps for products, filters, and other modules. 
- Define your models, including `Product`, `Category`, `Brand`, and any other necessary entities.

**Sample Data:**

- Generate a large dataset of products (e.g., 1000 entries) to test filtering performance and UX. 
- Use libraries like Faker or Factory Boy for realistic names, categories, brands, and pricing.

**Migrations:**

- Apply initial database migrations to ensure your models are correctly set up.  
- This prepares the system for filtering logic, indexing, and optimization later.

## Step 1: QuerySets and Unit Tests

**Goal:** Validate the correctness of filters and ensure reliable data retrieval.

**Explore QuerySets:**

- Use the Django shell to experiment with QuerySets.  
- Verify that filtering by category, brand, status, or price returns the expected results.

**Unit Testing:**

- Create tests to assert that each filtering scenario works as intended.  
- Unit tests prevent regressions and allow you to confidently add new features without breaking existing logic.

---

## Step 2: Views & Templates with GET Filters

**Goal:** Enable manual filtering via GET parameters in a user-friendly interface.

### Manual Filtering
### ![](/static/images/manual_fil.png)

**Template Setup:**

- Build sidebar filters for categories, brands, status, and price ranges.  
- Users select checkboxes or dropdowns to apply filters.

**Apply Button:**

- Initially, users must click an Apply button to update results.  
- This ensures controlled submission and allows testing of QuerySet logic in the backend.

**Pagination:**

- Implement pagination to handle large datasets efficiently.  
- Each page should reflect the current filters in the URL so results are shareable and bookmarkable.

## Step 3: Django Filter Integration + Multi-Select Tags

### Django Filters
### ![](/static/images/dj_filters.png)

**Goal:** Simplify backend filtering and improve UX with multi-select capabilities.

**Django Filter Integration:**

- Use FilterSets to declaratively define filters.  
- This keeps the backend clean and avoids repetitive QuerySet code.

**Clean URLs:**

- Generated URLs reflect the selected filters in a readable and shareable format.

**Active Tags:**

- Show currently applied filters as tags above the product list.  
- Users can remove individual tags to update the results instantly, providing an intuitive experience.

**Multi-Select Support:**

- Users can select multiple categories, brands, statuses, or price ranges simultaneously.  
- The system handles all combinations efficiently.

## Step 4: Faceting Sidebar + Clear Filters (Detailed UX Patterns)

**Goal:** Provide a seamless and intuitive user experience for filtering products, enabling users to explore multiple facets and reset selections efficiently.

## 4.1 Checkbox + Apply Button

### Django Filters
### ![](/static/images/ch_apply.png)

- **User Interaction:** Users select filter checkboxes and click an Apply button to update results.  
- **Controlled Submission:** This ensures backend `QuerySets` are only queried after user confirmation.  
- **Pagination Compatibility:** Selected filters persist across pages when using the Apply button.  

## 4.2 Instant Filtering (AJAX)


### Django Filters
### ![](/static/images/instant.png)

- **Automatic Updates:** Filters update the product list immediately after selection, without needing an Apply button.  
- **Seamless UX:** Reduces friction and improves responsiveness.  
- **Partial Page Updates:** Only the product list and active tags refresh via AJAX, keeping the sidebar intact.  

## 4.3 Multi-Select with Tags

### Django Filters
### ![](/static/images/multi.png)

- **Simultaneous Selection:** Users can select multiple options per category and across categories.  
- **Active Filter Tags:** Selected filters are displayed as removable tags above the product list.  
- **Cumulative Filtering:** Logical combination (AND across categories, OR within a category) ensures accurate results.  

## 4.4 Clear Options

### Django Filters
### ![](/static/images/clear.png)

- **Reset Mechanism:** A dedicated Clear Filters button resets all checkboxes and dropdowns.  
- **Real-Time Update:** Product list and facet counts update immediately after clearing.  
- **User Control:** Provides a quick way to start a fresh search.  

## 4.5 Clear Filters via Redirect (Unfiltered URL)

- **Redirection Approach:** Clicking the Clear Filters button can redirect to the base URL without query parameters.  
- **UX Benefit:** Ensures users see the unfiltered dataset in a clean, shareable URL.  

## 4.6 Clear Filters by Tags and Instant Updates

- **Tag-Based Removal:** Each active tag has an “×” icon for removing a specific filter.  
- **Automatic Sync:** Corresponding checkboxes or dropdowns reset when a tag is removed.  
- **Selective Control:** Allows users to refine filters without clearing all selections.  
- **AJAX-Powered:** Tag removal or clearing updates the product list instantly.  
- **Partial Rendering:** Only affected components (products and tags) refresh.  
- **Smooth Experience:** Users see immediate results without page reloads, maintaining context.

## Step 5: Optimization and Performance

**Goal:** Make the filter engine production-ready, fast, and scalable. We can monitor and measure on Django Debug Tool (DJDT)


### Django Filters
### ![](/static/images/debug_tool.png)

### 5.1 Indexes (Schema-Level)

- Add indexes on frequently filtered fields such as status, price, and created_at.  
- Use composite indexes for commonly queried field combinations to improve database read performance.

### 5.2 Avoid N+1 Queries

- Use `select_related` for single-valued relationships.  
- Use `prefetch_related` for many-to-many or reverse relationships.  
- This avoids unnecessary queries when accessing related objects in templates.

### 5.3 Caching Filtering Results and Facet Counts

- Cache rendered fragments or serialized results to reduce repetitive expensive queries.  
- Use Redis or Django cache backends with smart keying based on filter parameters.  
- Invalidate caches on updates or use a short TTL for freshness.

### 5.4 Pagination & Result Limits

- Always paginate large datasets to prevent heavy queries and slow rendering.  
- Include page numbers in cache keys to avoid cache collisions.

### 5.5 Monitoring & Diagnostics

- Use Django Debug Toolbar or production monitoring tools to inspect query counts and performance.  
- Enforce query budgets in tests to detect regressions early.

### 5.6 Denormalization (Optional)

- Maintain denormalized counts such as Category.product_count to reduce COUNT() queries for facets.  
- Update counts via signals on product creation and deletion, ensuring atomicity and consistency.

### 5.7 Query Count Enforcement

- Measure the number of queries executed for a product list page, including template rendering.  
- Define an acceptable query limit to guarantee efficiency.

### 5.8 UX Considerations for High Performance

- Ensure faceted filters, multi-select tags, and pagination respond instantly.  
- Cache-intensive operations and prefetching reduce load times, maintaining a smooth user experience.
